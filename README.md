# Noetik: RL Model with transparent and interpretable policies to better understand the agent's behavior

# Goals
- Use social media interaction data to understand how people engage with content and what keeps them returning.

- Analyze user behavior to uncover patterns of attention, preference, and emotional response in digital environments.

- Model engagement as a reinforcement process to explore how social media platforms shape user habits.

- Build a framework that can extend to other domains, such as psychometric or behavioral datasets, for broader studies of human decision-making.

# Model Overview & Architecture
## Overview
- Environment: Based on the KuaiRand dataset, representing realistic userâ€“video interactions on social media platforms.

- Agent: A reinforcement learning agent trained to model and explain user engagement behavior.

- Policy Network: Transformer-based architecture with attention to capture how past interactions influence current content choices.

- Interpretability Layer: Translates model reasoning into human-understandable explanations showing why certain actions or recommendations occur.

- Trainer: Uses a multi-objective optimization that balances engagement modeling with interpretability and transparency.

# Novelty
- Treats social media interaction as a reinforcement learning process, simulating how users learn and adapt through feedback.

- Embeds interpretability directly into the RL design, allowing insight into both model and human decision processes.

- Uses attention not just for prediction accuracy but as a tool for behavioral interpretation.

- Shifts the focus from maximizing engagement to understanding the cognitive and emotional mechanisms behind it.

- Provides a foundation that can generalize to psychometric and behavioral research beyond social media.

# Current Dataset:

The following figure gives an example of the dataset. It illustrates a user interaction sequence along with the user's rich feedback signals.

These feedback signals are collected from the two main user interfaces (UI) in the Kuaishou APP shown as follows:
